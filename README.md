# static-site-express
static-site-express is a simple Node.js based static-site generator (SSG) that uses EJS and Markdown. You can deploy your static site/blog to Netlify. (it is also possible to run the server application on Heroku, but it is not the intended usage of this SSG)


## MANUAL

### 1. Installation

`npm install static-site-express`


### 2. Build site and serve it at localhost:4000

`npm run build`

`npm run serve`

Or you can watch for changes and re-build site with nodemon:

`npm run watch`

Inspect `site.config.js` first. A lot of things are self explanatory. There are comments in the codes.

The `script/` folder contains the JS files used for building the site and serving it at `localhost:4000`.


### 3. Register at Netlify and publish your website

Register [here](https://www.netlify.com/), and [see this tutorial video](https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment/).

Build command is: `npm run build`

Publish directory is: `public`


### 5. You can also use the Express server app on Heroku

The server will run on Heroku, but you need improve security!
(For serving on localhost there is no need for this). Again, this is not the intended usage, but it works too.

For example, you really should set security headers with the `helmet` npm package:

````javascript
// Set Security Headers.
const helmet = require('helmet')

app.use(helmet())
````

You can also add CSP:

````javascript
// Content Security Policy.
const csp = require('helmet-csp')

// An example, with some exeptions:
app.use(csp({
  directives: {
    defaultSrc: [`'self'`],
    styleSrc: [`'self'`, 'https://fonts.googleapis.com', 'https://www.youtube.com'],
    fontSrc: [`'self'`, 'https://fonts.gstatic.com/'],
    scriptSrc: [`'self'`, 'https://www.youtube.com','https://www.googletagmanager.com', 'https://www.google-analytics.com'],
    childSrc: [`'self'`, 'https://www.youtube.com'],
    imgSrc: [`'self'`, 'www.google-analytics.com'],
    objectSrc: [`'self'`],
    connectSrc: [`'self'`]
  }
}))
````

You need to have a `Procfile` for Heroku (already supplied for you) with the following content:

`web: npm run heroku`

You have to build the site in the `public/` folder first. Change the `.gitignore` rules too!


#### The idea of making a static site generator came from this article:

* Douglas Matoso 2017. [Build a static site generator in 40 lines with Node.js](https://medium.com/douglas-matoso-english/build-static-site-generator-nodejs-8969ebe34b22)
